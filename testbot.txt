Greeting message goes here. If this greeting message is empty, i.e. if the script starts directly with a command, the bot will wait for the user to send the first message. To continue, please send any kind of text. E.g. "Hello world!".

% wait-for text
% notify admins A new user has replied to the greeting message.

To continue, say "continue". Note that the matching function is case-sensitive.

% wait-for text %match% continue %otherwise% You did not say "continue".

To continue, say "friend".

% wait-for text %match% friend

To continue, send an image.

% wait-for image %otherwise% This is not an image.

To continue, send a voice message.

% wait-for voice %otherwise% This is not a voice message.

To continue, send three separate text messages followed by a single voice message. There will be no further user interaction until all four messages have arrived.

% wait-for text

Thank you for sending the four messages as requested. You can now send any messages you want, including none. The chatbot should get back to you in roughly one minute.

% wait 1 min

This is the end of the chatbot simulation program. You can still send messages to this chat, but you will not get any further replies. Thank you for playing.

% notify admins A user has finished the script. %attach% contact.vcf chat_log.txt
